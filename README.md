# oneM2M Resource Tree structure
We have created a decentralised IoT solution consisting of a central IN-CSE and 3 MN-CSEs. This type of architecture is easily scalable for large scale systems
such as Smart City and enables seamless interaction between heterogeneous applications independent of underlying communication technologies.

* CSE registration 
i. To create the resource tree, first initialise the IN-CSE and then the three MN-CSEs by executing the "start.bat" script on Windows or "start.sh" on Linux and Mac OS.
